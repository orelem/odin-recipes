		<h2>
			Steps
		</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>				
				Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and grease a 9-inch square pan.
			</li>
			<li>				
				Mix together sugar, flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder.
			</li>
			<li>				
				In a separate bowl, whisk together butter, eggs, and vanilla. Add the butter mixture to the flour mixture and mix until well combined.
			</li>
			<li>				
				Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan and smooth it out with a spatula. Add 16 Oreo cookies in an even layer on top of the batter, then spread the remaining half of the batter over the cookies.
			</li>
			<li>				
				Bake the brownies until the edges are brown and the center is set, 30 to 35 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>				
				Remove the pan from the oven and set it on a wire rack to cool. Let the brownies cool completely, at least 30 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>				
				Crush 12 of the remaining Oreo cookies. In a bowl, mix together the whipped topping and the crushed cookies. Spread the mixture over the top of the brownies. Crush the remaining 4 cookies and sprinkle them over the whipped cream mixture.

				Keep the brownies refrigerated until you are ready to slice and serve them.
