			<li>				
				In a small bowl, whisk together 2 eggs, the juice of one lemon, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Beat this mixture into the butter mixture on low speed.
			</li>

				In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 3/4 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Gradually add this flour mixture to the egg mixture on low speed until just combined. Cover the dough and chill it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
